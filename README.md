notepad-plus-plus-Vectorscript
==============================

Add syntax and keywords to NotePad++ (needs some cleanup) worked with 5.9.6.2 (November 2011 version).

There was no support for Windows based editing of Vectorscript in 2009 when I created it. It continues to be downloaded from time to time, so I imagine Nemetschek has not created any additional tools.

The base for this was VectorScript version 12. Happy coding.
